Software is self installing, creating required configuration file and 
database structure with default data. Please read carefully INSTALL file!
The release version stored in INI file is automatically updated by the
application if needed.
Please read carefully CHANGELOG file for details of new features.

IMPORTANT: a bug in database structure was found and fixed on 1.0pre5.
Please delete your database and recreate it (installation procedure will
take care about creating a new database BUT NOT DELETING THE OLD AND
BUGGED ONE) if you are upgrading from this prerelease.

I can assume that this 1.0pre14 prerelease may be considered quite
stable and maybe used in production environments. But please test it
intensively before putting it in production and report any bugs you may
find to the author!

Do not try to use the sql file you find on download site for 1.0 branch,
since it's done only for 0.x versions.

Since it is BETA version, there is no guarantee that this software 
- will work with your computer
- it's bug-free
The author is not liable for any problem caused by this software, even
if it destroys your computer :-)
BTW, your report, with detailed description of error messages and all
about your problem, is really appreciated.

*********
IMPORTANT
*********
It's always recommended to install a new prerelease of CrisoftRicette in
a different directory than the already installed previous prerelease.
However you can replicate the same configuration and use the same
database of older 1.0preXX

FEATURES
--------
CrisoftRicette is a cooking recipe archiving software written in PHP,
interfacing a MySQL database and released under GNU GPL license.
This software is targeted for home users, even this application may be
used also on Internet sites.
A full version ready for websites (with necessary requirements, for
example admin sumbissions of newly inserted recipes, displayed only
after admin approval, counter for displayed recipes and so on) may be
developed only after 1.0 final version release. If you want to start a
hack targeted to website please contact me.

It features:
- archiving a recipe in a MySQL database, with all data needed, even a
  photo/videoclip
- easy to mantain categories for type of dish and cooking type
- nice printing through PHP PDF functions (it doesn't need anymore PHP's 
  own PDF functions since it now uses enclosed fpdf class, thanks to
  Olivier Plathey, creator of fpdf)
- send an e-mail with a recipe to a friend
- multiple searches on the database
- anyone can insert a recipe, but only superuser (admin) may delete or
  modify
- initialization of the software through an INI file (ascii text)
- full I18N (internationalization) support
- interface easy-to-modify through a header/footer files system
- full PHP session support to store main and temporary variables
and lots more...
