SHORT HELP FOR TRANSLATORS
--------------------------
If you want to tranlsate message file of CrisoftRicette you can look at
lang/en.php (for english language file) or lang/it.php file (if you know
italian).
Open the file in your favorite editor (even if I suggest you ViM,
http://www.vim.org, that features a very useful syntax highlighting for
PHP) then start to translate replacing messages with the ones in your
language.

Before your really begin to translate please:
rename en.php (or it.php) file into XX.php, where XX is your iso country
code (de for Germany, fr for France and so on). If you are in doubt
please ask!

Then edit translator informations (they are immediately below GPL
License notice)

/*
 *	CrisoftRicette language file
 *	Language: italiano
 *	Translated by: Lorenzo Pulici snowdog@tiscalinet.it
 *	File: lang/it.php
 */

should be edited (for german version) as:

/*
 *	CrisoftRicette language file
 *	Language: deutsch
 *	Translated by: Hans Weiss email@adresse.de
 *	File: lang/de.php
 */

Then you can begin the translation.
This is very easy to do, just translate the text in the second field
with double quotes for every define().
Please DO NOT TRANSLATE the all uppercase text! Otherwise Crisoftricette
will stop to work generating lots of errors.

For example, in the german translation

define("MSG_NOT_SPECIFIED", "Not specified");

will become

define("MSG_NOT_SPECIFIED", "Nicht spezifiziert");

Very easy, isn't it?
Again, if you are in doubt, do not hesitate to ask me!
